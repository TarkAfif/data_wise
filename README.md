# Hello, I am Afif !
I created a small toolkit that performs various operations with bits, bytes, and data. It includes functions for setting, resetting, and retrieving bits, as well as reading and writing bytes. If you need to handle a bunch of data, this library has you covered. It's written using only the 'stdint.h' library, making it easy to integrate into your project. To prevent confusion about the 'int' size type on certain controllers, this library uses 'uintx_t' types.

It's useful for:

- People who work on small computer systems that don't handle data structures well.
- Students learning about data in the C programming language.
- Anyone working on projects that talk to small computer parts and wants to know what they're saying and how to work with the information.
